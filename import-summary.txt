ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From UDesk.library:
* .DS_Store
From udesk_android_sdk_demo:
* .DS_Store
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In UDesk.library:
* AndroidManifest.xml => uDesklibrary/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => uDesklibrary/src/main/assets
* libs/android-async-http-1.4.6.jar => uDesklibrary/libs/android-async-http-1.4.6.jar
* libs/apiEngine_v1.1.0.jar => uDesklibrary/libs/apiEngine_v1.1.0.jar
* libs/asmack-android-8-4.0.6.jar => uDesklibrary/libs/asmack-android-8-4.0.6.jar
* libs/qiniu-android-sdk-7.0.1.jar => uDesklibrary/libs/qiniu-android-sdk-7.0.1.jar
* libs/udesk_sdk_2.0.7.jar => uDesklibrary/libs/udesk_sdk_2.0.7.jar
* res/ => uDesklibrary/src/main/res/
* src/ => uDesklibrary/src/main/java
In udesk_android_sdk_demo:
* AndroidManifest.xml => udesk_android_sdk_demo/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => udesk_android_sdk_demo/src/main/assets/
* lint.xml => udesk_android_sdk_demo/lint.xml
* res/ => udesk_android_sdk_demo/src/main/res/
* src/ => udesk_android_sdk_demo/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
